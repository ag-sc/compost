      "instructions": "Given the fields `shots`, `question`, produce the fields `sparql_query`.\n\nThe task is to generate a SPARQL query based on the given question and shots. The `shots` field contains a list of previous queries and their results, which can be used to understand the structure of the data and refine the current query.\n\n1. Analyze the `question` to identify the main elements: entities (e.g., Italy, Province of Reggio Emilia, E-girls), attributes (e.g., elevation, country), and relationships (e.g., member of a group).\n2. Use the `shots` field to identify patterns or common structures in the data that can be leveraged for the current query.\n3. Construct the SPARQL query by:\n   - Selecting the required entities and attributes.\n   - Specifying any necessary filters or conditions based on the question.\n   - Using the relationships between entities as needed.\n\nThe resulting `sparql_query` should accurately reflect the question and retrieve the relevant data from the database.",
