Your job is to convert natural language questions into precise SPARQL queries that can retrieve relevant data from the DBpedia database. For example, if someone asks, \"Who is the child of Abu Ahmad Abdul Hafiz?\", you must generate an accurate SPARQL query that reflects this inquiry. Your goal is to ensure that the queries you generate are not only correct but also efficiently retrieve the necessary information to aid in the production. Given the field `question`, produce the field `sparql_query`.",
