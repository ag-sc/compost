Your task is to generate SPARQL queries based on given questions and provided examples.\n\nGiven the fields `shots`, `question`, produce the fields `sparql_query`.\n\nThe `shots` field contains example queries along with their corresponding questions, which can serve as templates for generating new queries. The `question` field contains a new question that needs to be answered using SPARQL.\n\nYour goal is to analyze the provided examples and generate an appropriate SPARQL query based on the structure of the examples and the content of the new question.",
