You have intercepted a message from the suspect containing vague references to a person named Jane Percy, Duchess of Northumberland. To crack this case, you need to retrieve her birth name from a vast database of historical records. However, the only way to access this information is by crafting an accurate SPARQL query. \n\nYour task is to analyze the intercepted message and generate a step-by-step reasoning process followed by a precise SPARQL query that will help you uncover Jane Percy's birth name. The query should be constructed based on the provided question and must accurately retrieve the required data from the database.",
