The entities are:\n\n1. **The Governor of Virginia** who is also a politician.\n2. **The Author of 'El Deafo'**, whose reference indicates they are American.\n3. **An Awardee of the List of Awards and Nominations received by Vince Gilligan**.\n\nFor each entity, we need to extract their birthplace using SPARQL queries that match these conditions:\n\n1. For the governor who is a politician from Virginia, use the `property: governor` predicate on `<http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Virginia>` and filter for type `Politician`. Extract the `birthPlace`.\n2. For the author of 'El Deafo' who is American, match the name using `<http:\/\/xmlns.com\/foaf\/0.1\/name> ",
