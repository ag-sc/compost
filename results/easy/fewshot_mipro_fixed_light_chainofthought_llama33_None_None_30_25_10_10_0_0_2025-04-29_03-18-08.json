      "instructions": "To generate the SPARQL query for the given question, we need to follow these steps:\n1. Identify the entities involved: The governor of Virginia who is a politician, the author of \"El Deafo\" that is American, and the awardee of \"List of awards and nominations received by Vince Gilligan\".\n2. Determine the relevant DBpedia properties and resources for each entity.\n3. Construct the SPARQL query using the identified properties and resources.\n\nGiven the question: \"Give me the birth place of the governor, that is a politician, of Virginia and birth place of the author of the reference, that is American, to El Deafo and birth place of the awardee of List of awards and nominations received by Vince Gilligan.\"\n\nThe SPARQL query should look like this:\n```sparql\nSELECT ?result \nWHERE {\n  # Governor of Virginia who is a politician\n  <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Virginia> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/property\/governor> ?governor .\n  ?governor <http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/02\/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/Politician> .\n  ?governor <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/birthPlace> ?result .\n\n  # Author of \"El Deafo\" that is American\n  ?elDeafo <http:\/\/xmlns.com\/foaf\/0.1\/name> \"El Deafo\"@en .\n  ?elDeafo <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/country> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/United_States> .\n  ?elDeafo <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/property\/author> ?author .\n  ?author <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/birthPlace> ?result .\n\n  # Awardee of \"List of awards and nominations received by Vince Gilligan\"\n  ?awardee <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/property\/awards> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Vince_Gilligan> .\n  ?awardee <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/birthPlace> ?result .\n}\n```\nHowever, the provided SPARQL query seems incomplete as it doesn't properly separate the conditions for each entity with optional or union operators, which might lead to incorrect results due to the nature of SPARQL queries requiring all conditions in a single block to be true. \n\nA corrected version should consider using `UNION` or `OPTIONAL` to ensure that the query correctly identifies the birth places without requiring all conditions to match a single entity:\n```sparql\nSELECT ?result \nWHERE {\n  {\n    # Governor of Virginia who is a politician\n    <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Virginia> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/property\/governor> ?governor .\n    ?governor <http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/02\/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/Politician> .\n    ?governor <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/birthPlace> ?result .\n  } UNION {\n    # Author of \"El Deafo\" that is American\n    ?elDeafo <http:\/\/xmlns.com\/foaf\/0.1\/name> \"El Deafo\"@en .\n    ?elDeafo <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/country> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/United_States> .\n    ?elDeafo <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/property\/author> ?author .\n    ?author <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/birthPlace> ?result .\n  } UNION {\n    # Awardee of \"List of awards and nominations received by Vince Gilligan\"\n    ?awardee <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/property\/awards> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Vince_Gilligan> .\n    ?awardee <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/birthPlace> ?result .\n  }\n}\n```\nThis corrected query uses `UNION` to combine the conditions for each entity, ensuring that it will return the birth places for any of the entities mentioned in the question.\n\nThe final answer is: \n```sparql\nSELECT ?result \nWHERE {\n  {\n    # Governor of Virginia who is a politician\n    <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Virginia> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/property\/governor> ?governor .\n    ?governor <http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/02\/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/Politician> .\n    ?governor <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/birthPlace> ?result .\n  } UNION {\n    # Author of \"El Deafo\" that is American\n    ?elDeafo <http:\/\/xmlns.com\/foaf\/0.1\/name> \"El Deafo\"@en .\n    ?elDeafo <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/country> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/United_States> .\n    ?elDeafo <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/property\/author> ?author .\n    ?author <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/birthPlace> ?result .\n  } UNION {\n    # Awardee of \"List of awards and nominations received by Vince Gilligan\"\n    ?awardee <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/property\/awards> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Vince_Gilligan> .\n    ?awardee <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/birthPlace> ?result .\n  }\n}\n```\n\n[[ ## step-by-step-solution ]]\n\n1. **Identify Entities and Properties**: Identify the entities (governor of Virginia, author of \"El Deafo\", awardee of Vince Gilligan's awards) and their respective properties (birth place).\n\n2. **Construct SPARQL Query**: Use the identified entities and properties to construct a SPARQL query. \n\n3. **Use UNION for Separate Conditions**: Ensure that separate conditions for each entity are properly combined using `UNION` to avoid requiring all conditions to match a single entity.\n\n4. **Finalize SPARQL Query**: Finalize the SPARQL query by ensuring it correctly retrieves the birth places for any of the mentioned entities without needing all conditions to be true for a single entity.\n\n[[ ## final-answer ]]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{}$ \n\nHowever, since this format requires a specific type of answer and given that the solution involves a SPARQL query which does not fit into the \"$\\boxed{answer}$\" format as it's not a numerical or simple textual answer but rather a code snippet, I'll provide it directly here for clarity:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT ?result \nWHERE {\n  {\n    # Governor of Virginia who is a politician\n    <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Virginia> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/property\/governor> ?governor .\n    ?governor <http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/02\/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/Politician> .\n    ?governor <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/birthPlace> ?result .\n  } UNION {\n    # Author of \"El Deafo\" that is American\n    ?elDeafo <http:\/\/xmlns.com\/foaf\/0.1\/name> \"El Deafo\"@en .\n    ?elDeafo <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/country> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/United_States> .\n    ?elDeafo <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/property\/author> ?author .\n    ?author <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/birthPlace> ?result .\n  } UNION {\n    # Awardee of \"List of awards and nominations received by Vince Gilligan\"\n    ?awardee <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/property\/awards> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Vince_Gilligan> .\n    ?awardee <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/birthPlace> ?result .\n  }\n}\n```\n\n[[ ## final-thoughts ]]\n\nThis SPARQL query is designed to retrieve the birth places of the governor of Virginia who is a politician, the author of \"El Deafo\" who is American, and the awardee of Vince Gilligan's awards. It uses `UNION` to ensure that it can find the birth place for any of these entities without requiring all conditions to be met by a single entity.\n\n[[ ## conclusion ]]\n\nThe provided solution involves creating a SPARQL query that correctly identifies and retrieves the birth places for the mentioned entities using DBpedia properties and resources. The use of `UNION` allows the query to effectively handle separate conditions for each entity, ensuring accurate results.\n\n[[ ## final-answer-box ]]\n\nGiven the nature of this problem and its solution, it's clear that the answer involves a specific SPARQL query designed to address the question posed. However, since the format typically expects a boxed numerical or simple textual answer which doesn't apply here due to the complexity and nature of the query as an answer, I've provided the detailed explanation and final SPARQL query above.\n\n[[ ## the-end ]]\n\nThe final answer is: \n```sparql\nSELECT ?result \nWHERE {\n  {\n    # Governor of Virginia who is a politician\n    <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Virginia> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/property\/governor> ?governor .\n    ?governor <http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/02\/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/Politician> .\n    ?governor <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/birthPlace> ?result .\n  } UNION {\n    # Author of \"El Deafo\" that is American\n    ?elDeafo <http:\/\/xmlns.com\/foaf\/0.1\/name> \"El Deafo\"@en .\n    ?elDeafo <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/country> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/United_States> .\n    ?elDeafo <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/property\/author> ?author .\n    ?author <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/birthPlace> ?result .\n  } UNION {\n    # Awardee of \"List of awards and nominations received by Vince Gilligan\"\n    ?awardee <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/property\/awards> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Vince_Gilligan> .\n    ?awardee <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/birthPlace> ?result .\n  }\n}\n```",
