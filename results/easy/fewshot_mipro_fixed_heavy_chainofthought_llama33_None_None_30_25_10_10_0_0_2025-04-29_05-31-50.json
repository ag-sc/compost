      "instructions": "To generate a SPARQL query that retrieves the birth places of the governor of Virginia who is a politician, the author of the book \"El Deafo\" that is American, and the awardee of the \"List of awards and nominations received by Vince Gilligan\", we will use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the DBpedia resources for Virginia, El Deafo, and the award.\n2. Use the `dbpedia.org\/property\/governor` property to find the governor of Virginia.\n3. Filter the results to only include governors who are politicians by using the `dbpedia.org\/ontology\/Politician` type.\n4. Retrieve the birth place of the governor using the `dbpedia.org\/ontology\/birthPlace` property.\n5. Identify the author of El Deafo by using the `dbpedia.org\/property\/author` property and filter the results to only include authors who are American by using the `dbpedia.org\/ontology\/country` property with the value `dbpedia.org\/resource\/United_States`.\n6. Retrieve the birth place of the author using the `dbpedia.org\/ontology\/birthPlace` property.\n7. Identify the awardee of the \"List of awards and nominations received by Vince Gilligan\" by using the `dbpedia.org\/property\/awards` property.\n8. Retrieve the birth place of the awardee using the `dbpedia.org\/ontology\/birthPlace` property.\n\nThe resulting SPARQL query will be:\n```sparql\nSELECT ?result \nWHERE {\n  # Governor of Virginia who is a politician\n  <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Virginia> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/property\/governor> ?governor .\n  ?governor <http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/02\/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/Politician> .\n  ?governor <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/birthPlace> ?result .\n\n  # Author of \"El Deafo\" that is American\n  ?elDeafo <http:\/\/xmlns.com\/foaf\/0.1\/name> \"El Deafo\"@en .\n  ?elDeafo <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/country> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/United_States> .\n  ?elDeafo <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/property\/author> ?author .\n  ?author <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/birthPlace> ?result .\n\n  # Awardee of \"List of awards and nominations received by Vince Gilligan\"\n  ?awardee <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/property\/awards> <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Vince_Gilligan> .\n  ?awardee <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/birthPlace> ?result .\n}\n```",
