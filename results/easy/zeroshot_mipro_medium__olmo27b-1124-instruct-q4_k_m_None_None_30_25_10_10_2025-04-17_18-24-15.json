The instruction should emphasize the need to understand the question contextually and map it onto the appropriate structured data fields within DBpedia.\n\nHere's a proposed instruction:\n\n**Proposed Instruction:**\n\n\"From the provided question, extract key entities and relationships described in the natural language text. Use your understanding of the DBpedia schema, focusing on properties such as `rdfs:label` for names and titles, and relations like `dbpedia2:associatedMusicalArtist` or `dc:creator` to link entities across different domains. Formulate a SPARQL query that will accurately retrieve the information requested by matching these entities and relationships against the DBpedia dataset.",
