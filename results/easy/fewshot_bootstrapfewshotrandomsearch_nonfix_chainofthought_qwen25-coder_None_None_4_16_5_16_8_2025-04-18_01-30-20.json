He was inaugurated in January 2021.\n\nTo answer this question accurately, we need to find the birthplaces of these individuals:\n- **Vince Gilligan**: Born in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n- **Cece Bell**: Born in Nashville, Tennessee.\n- **Glenn Youngkin**: Born in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nTherefore, the query should return three different birthplaces.",
