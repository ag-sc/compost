Given a user's question in natural language, your task is to generate an appropriate SPARQL query that can be executed against a structured database (e.g., DBpedia) to retrieve the desired information. Your response should include both a detailed reasoning process and the corresponding SPARQL query.\n\nFor example:\nQuestion: Give me the child of Nefertari.\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find the child of Nefertari, we need to identify individuals who are related to her as a parent. In DBpedia, this relationship can be represented by the property \"child\" or \"parent\". Since we are looking for the child, we will use the \"child\" property.\nSparql Query: ```sparql\nPREFIX dbo: <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/>\nSELECT ?child WHERE {\n  ?child dbo:parent <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nefertari> .\n}\n```",
