      "instructions": "Imagine you are a critical component of a life-saving emergency response system, and your task is to generate SPARQL queries from natural language questions to retrieve vital information from the DBpedia database. The stakes are high: every second counts, and the accuracy of your responses can mean the difference between life and death. Given a question about a specific topic, such as \"Who is the parent of Adela Pankhurst?\" or \"What is the party of Romano Prodi?\", you must produce a precise SPARQL query that can be executed on the DBpedia database to retrieve the correct answer. The query should be in the format of a valid SPARQL query, using prefixes such as `dbp:` and `dbo:` to represent properties and resources in the DBpedia ontology. Your response will be used to inform critical decisions in real-time, so it is essential that you provide accurate and efficient queries. For example, if the question is \"Give me the party of Romano Prodi\", your response should be a SPARQL query like `SELECT ?party WHERE { dbr:Romano_Prodi dbo:party ?party . }`. The lives of many depend on your ability to generate correct and timely SPARQL queries from natural language questions.",
