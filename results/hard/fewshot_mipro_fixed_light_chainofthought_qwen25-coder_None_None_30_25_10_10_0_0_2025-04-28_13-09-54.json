You will be provided with a set of example queries (`shots`) and a new question, and your task is to produce an appropriate SPARQL query that answers the new question.\n\nTo help you better understand the task, here's how it works:\n1. **Understand the Examples**: Review the `shots` to identify patterns or common structures in the SPARQL queries.\n2. **Analyze the New Question**: Carefully read and comprehend the new `question`.\n3. **Generate the Query**: Using the insights from the examples, construct a SPARQL query that accurately answers the new question.\n\nRemember, the goal is to create a query that is both correct and efficient, following the structure observed in the example queries.",
