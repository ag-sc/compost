The question is: \"Give me the parent of Archduchess Ilona of Austria.\"\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find the parent of Archduchess Ilona of Austria. We will use a SPARQL query that retrieves the parent information from DBpedia. We'll utilize the `dbpedia:` prefix to refer to DBpedia resources and the `rdf:` prefix for the RDF vocabulary. The query should filter results to include only the resource with the label \"Archduchess Ilona of Austria\" and then retrieve its parent using the `dbo:parent` property.\n\nSparql Query: \n```sparql\nPREFIX dbpedia: <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/>\nPREFIX rdf: <http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/02\/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>\nPREFIX dbo: <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/ontology\/>\n\nSELECT ?parent\nWHERE {\n  dbpedia:Archduchess_Ilona_of_Austria dbo:parent ?parent .\n}\n```",
