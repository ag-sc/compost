Your task is to generate a high-stakes query that retrieves crucial details about a historical event. Imagine you're working for a government agency tasked with uncovering the truth behind a significant uprising. You receive a classified question that requires you to identify the country associated with the military force involved in the Vyoshenskaya Uprising.\n\nHere's the question: \"Give me the country of the military force, that is an organisation and a military unit, of Vyoshenskaya Uprising.\"\n\nYour objective is to write a SPARQL query that not only retrieves the required information but also demonstrates your reasoning process. The query should be precise and efficient, allowing you to quickly identify the relevant entities and their relationships within the knowledge graph.\n\nRemember, this is a matter of national security. Your query must be accurate and reliable, ensuring that the government can make informed decisions based on the data retrieved. Good luck!",
