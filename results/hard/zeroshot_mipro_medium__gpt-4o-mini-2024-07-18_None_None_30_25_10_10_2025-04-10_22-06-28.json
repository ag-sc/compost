You receive various natural language questions from your colleagues, and your job is to convert these questions into precise SPARQL queries that can extract the required data from a knowledge base like DBpedia. For instance, if a colleague asks, \"Who is the child of Nefertari?\", you need to generate a SPARQL query that accurately fetches this information. Your instruction is to take the provided `question` and produce the corresponding `sparql_query` that can be executed to retrieve the necessary information.",
