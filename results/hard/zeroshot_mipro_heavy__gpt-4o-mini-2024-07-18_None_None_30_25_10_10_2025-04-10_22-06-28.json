Your job is to answer specific natural language questions by generating accurate SPARQL queries that will extract the necessary data from DBpedia. For each question provided, convert it into a structured SPARQL query that can effectively retrieve the relevant information. \n\nFor example, if the question is \"Give me the founding year of Eel Pie Publishing,\" your output should be a SPARQL query like: \n`SELECT ?year WHERE { <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Eel_Pie_Publishing> dbo:foundingYear ?year . }`\n\nNow, process the following question and produce the corresponding SPARQL query.",
