Your task is to analyze the provided examples (shots) and use them to create a query that answers the specific question asked.\n\nHere's how you can approach it:\n1. Understand the pattern in the given shots.\n2. Identify the relationships between entities mentioned in the shots.\n3. Use this understanding to construct a SPARQL query that accurately answers the question.\n\nFor example, if the shots involve finding children of certain individuals and their resting places, your query should also follow this structure.",
