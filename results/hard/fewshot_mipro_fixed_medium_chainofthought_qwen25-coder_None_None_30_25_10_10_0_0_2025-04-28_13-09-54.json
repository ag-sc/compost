The scenario is high stakes, as incorrect answers could lead to significant consequences in decision-making processes.\n\n**Scenario:**\nImagine you are working for a government department responsible for managing resources in different regions of a country. Your team has been provided with data about political parties and their leaders in various cities. You have been tasked with identifying the ruling party in a specific city, Sremski Karlovci, and finding an entity in Serbia associated with a particular political party.\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. Analyze the provided `shots` to understand the relationships between entities such as cities, parties, and their attributes.\n2. Use the information from the `shots` to construct a SPARQL query that answers the given `question`.\n3. Ensure that the query is accurate and retrieves the correct information.\n\n**Note:** The `shots` provide partial queries or patterns that can be used to build the final query. You may need to combine multiple `shots` and adjust the predicates and objects to fit the specific question.",
